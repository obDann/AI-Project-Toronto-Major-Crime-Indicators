This dashboard utilizes data coming from the Toronto Police Service, retrieved as of October 2024. The tab "MCI Dashboard" provides predictions for police divisions relative to date, location, type of crime, and premises type in order to inform resource allocations as well as to start conversations with audience members such as the City of Toronto and Toronto Police Service.

DISCLAIMER: Please keep in mind that there is always room for improvement and this is just a class project that acts as a Minimum Viable Product, but not something to be depended on as this course has no affiliation with the Toronto Police Service. Realistically, designing a product for the intended audience requires dialogue between developers and audience members.
